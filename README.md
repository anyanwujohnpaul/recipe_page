### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Media Queries


### What I learned

Building the recipe page was a nice experience, I've always felt like impostor before now but this project realised that i could do more than i thought by leveraging the tech community for support and also reading documentation. 

<h1>Thanks to everyone at Frontend mentor for all they do for the devloper's community</h1>



### Continued development

I look forward to getting better with CSS (the advanced part) and keeping on building/designing cool, user-centric and aesthetic UI for users.



### Useful resources

- [W3School CSS Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/css/) - This helped me learn and grasp CSS concept whilst working on this project and most especially solved the problem i stumbled across on this project.
